This code is to plot the projected density of states from the VASP output file for collinear cases only. It requires only POSCAR, DOSCAR files. Just edit the input file according to your system to obtain the output files in the seprate directory 'plot_files'.  please keep all the files in the same directory (POSCAR, DOSCAR, input, reduce.sh, vasp_plots.f90)  ################################### IN INPUT FILE THERE ARE THREE LINES ###################################  FIRST :: Number of species used in your POSCAR file SECOND :: ISPIN value used in INCAR file THIRD :: Last occupied shell (e.g., s, p, d, f), kindly see the PROCAR file  Note :: Please check the ISPIN value before executing this code!!  Feel free to contact me for any queries and improving this code.  Mukesh Kumar Sharma email ID :: msharma1@ph.iitr.ac.in, ms19@iitbbs.ac.in  Thanking you!!
